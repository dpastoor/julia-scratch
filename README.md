explorations in julia

Two key issues that I wanted to explore that Julia is lauded for are:

1) performace over R/Python natively (no c/c++ for me)

2) ability to use as a glue language. 

In regards to being used as a glue language, python definitely takes the cake, 
however if I am offloading computations to julia it would be potentially nice to reduce
the total number of dependencies.
